# Simple-Button

This HTML code creates a button element with the text "Click me!" inside it. When the button is clicked, it will perform the default action associated with the button element.

You can customize the appearance of the button using CSS.

This CSS code I have provided in this respiratory will give the button a green background color, white text, and rounded corners. You can customize these styles to your liking to create the button that you want.
